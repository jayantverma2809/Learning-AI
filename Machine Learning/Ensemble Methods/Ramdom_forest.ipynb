Random Forest is similar to Bagging using multiple model versions and aggregating the ensemble of models to make a single prediction. RF uses an ensemble of tree’s and introduces randomness into each tree by randomly selecting a subset of the features for each node to split on. This makes the predictions of each tree uncorrelated, improving results when the models are aggregated. In this lab, we will illustrate the sampling process of RF to Bagging, then demonstrate how each predictor for random forest are not correlated. Finally, we will apply Random Forests to several datasets using Grid-Search to find the optimum  Hyperparameters.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e0e7e198-e332-493e-97f6-1cbeea7b13f3","metadata":{},"source":["<h1>Table of contents</h1>\n","\n","* What's the difference between RF and Bagging\n","* Cancer Data Example"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"05404151-a679-4cab-b7ab-fbac3be2a8d8","metadata":{},"source":["Let's first import the required libraries:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"502aafc5-454b-44e2-98ef-cc84604be292","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import pylab as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import scipy.optimize as opt\n","from sklearn import preprocessing\n","%matplotlib inline \n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"88976327-eebe-46e2-b19e-f01e598f8008","metadata":{},"source":["Ignore error warnings\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"d94b33bb-6cc7-42b8-bfc4-b5129a68dcc7","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d42af3f-9a5b-4863-9150-abc77772d08d","metadata":{},"source":["This function will calculate the accuracy of the training and testing data given a model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"49415476-8115-466b-baca-7d5139baa190","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def get_accuracy(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, model):\n","    return  {\"test Accuracy\":metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test)),\"trian Accuracy\": metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, model.predict(X_train))}"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"338a1513-d99d-44ce-8877-3f33401b93fc","metadata":{},"source":["This function calculates the average correlation between predictors and displays the pairwise correlation between  predictors.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"533b9597-7832-4316-9679-edd5a8c62767","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#This function calculates the average correlation between predictors  \n","def get_correlation(X_test, y_test,models):\n","    n_estimators=len(models.estimators_)\n","    predictions=pd.DataFrame({'estimator '+str(n+1):[] for n in range(n_estimators)})\n","    \n","    for key,model in zip(predictions.keys(),models.estimators_):\n","        predictions[key]=model.predict(X_test.to_numpy())\n","    \n","    corr=predictions.corr()\n","    print(\"Average correlation between predictors: \", corr.mean().mean()-1/n_estimators)\n","    return corr"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d0bd1074-09e2-4d06-9523-a88bfcd532fc","metadata":{},"source":["<h2 id=\"RFvsBag\">  What's the difference between RF and Bagging </h2>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b98cf3cc-0b3e-499a-aeaf-94c1f537726d","metadata":{},"source":["RF is similar to Bagging in that it uses model ensembles to make predictions.
